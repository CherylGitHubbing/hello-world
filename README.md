# hello-world
For my IS210 Course-2nd week!

Hello Professor and Classmates,

Here we are in GitHub Land and it's a wonderful place to explore!
It's also where we will be learning and creating new Pythonic projects.
We will be collaborating here in GitHub because it's one of the best
in VCS systems--Version Control Systems that manages our coding projects.

Glad to be here!
